<li>Not yet. I haven't found a good way to make you be able to do so. Shouldn't be too hard, not a priority though. When the time comes and it's added, you'll need to be logged in to change it. If you're unable to do so, refer to below.</li>

                <li>That sucks! Contact us on Discord (linked on the sidebar) for help. You'll need a way to prove you own the account, by the way.</li>
