# RevTube: PHP video sharing software

*Maintaned by [Kaisiece](https://github.com/kaisiece) and [kylarz](https://github.com/ky-1).*

RevTube is a video <!--(with audio uploading a feature that was going to be added)--> sharing site designed as an alternative to YouTube and similar sites.
# Access the site 
<!--You can access RevTube at https://rev.yoretude.com.-->

RevTube is currently in development, so we do not have a public instance at this time.
<!--# Changelog (only shows latest major update)
## January 12, 2024
The RevTube branding has been restored. (Also it's been a little over 2 years since this project started so that's neat, I guess.)
