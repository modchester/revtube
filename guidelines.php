<br>
<li>Additionally, corrupted videos, defined as videos that cannot be played, will be deleted.</li>
<br>
<li>Shitposting is generally frowned upon, as it adds no value to our site. It is not necessarily against the rules however.</li>

</ul>
            <h2>Commenting Guidelines</h2>
            <ul class="unstyled">
            <li>Leaving multiple comments with no purpose or spamming will get your comment(s) deleted.</li>
<br>
<li>Posting links to your videos or profiles (links that lead off-platform included) is not allowed and carries the same punishment as above.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Strike System</h2>
        <ul class="unstyled">
            <li>Generally, an infraction (instance of breaking one of these rules) will give you 1 strike.</li><br><li> Unless it's something more severe (illegal content for example), you'll only get one strike for every infraction.</li><br><li> If you have 2 strikes, you lose your ability to upload/comment (depending on which rules you broke).</li><br><li>When your account reaches 3 strikes, it will be deactivated (meaning you will no longer be able to login), and all your videos will be hidden (or deleted, if they violated these guidelines)<!--deleted along with all your videos and comments-->.</li><br><li> Generally you can appeal these decisions. But depending on what you did and the severity of it, appeals may not be accepted.</li<br>
